<h1><strong>The First Project</strong></h1>
While discussing possible ideas for our final project, Polina came up with a project of linguistic mappig for the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avarâ€“Andic_languages">Avar-Andic languages</a> in Dagestan region of Russia. According to data of the languages spoken in different villages we plan to color-code them in Google Maps and then display them in some form of a graph.
<h2>Here's an outline of our plan:</h2>
<ol>
	<li>map the villages in Google maps</li>
	<li>categorize the styles according to the languages spoken there</li>
	<li>draw a graph depicting the languages of the Avar-Andic language branch</li>
</ol>
